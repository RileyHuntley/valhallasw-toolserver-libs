=====================

Current project:
----------------
* Preparations for the interwiki image search:
  * mySQLdb abstraction layer:
    Where other abstraction layers try to layer the sql output (making the commands sql server independent) or the input (making it easier to construct sql commands), I try to layer the commands. Instead of having to work through cursors, fetchalls etc, I just want to give a SQL command and have a list of [dictionaries][dictionary] returned to me.
    The semi-abstract current source is:
    <pre>cursor=self.db.cursor()
     cursor.execute(commands)
     cols=[x[0] for x in cursor.description()]
     return=[dict(zip(cols,x)) for x in cursor.fetchall()]</pre>

Nothing to see here folks, please move on!
